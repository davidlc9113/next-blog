# Why build a blog with Next.js

In the last few days, I've been learning React, which is one of the most popular front-end libraries. The most effective way to learn is by developing projects by hand, and a common project to start with is a blog.

**So the first reason is portfolio.** I can collect all my projects into a portfolio, then it's ready to send to employers.

The React official website [https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project](https://react.dev/learn/start-a-new-react-project) says, *"If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, we recommend picking one of the React-powered frameworks popular in the community."*. I agree. I find it much easier to develop this blog with a framework.

**I chose Next.js for another reason: itâ€™s at the top of the framework list.** It's pretty good! It has many examples and libraries, such as this Markdown parser: [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown).

## Conclusion

Well, it's just a start. I will add tests, CI/CD, and more. You can check the blog project on GitHub by the top right link of this page.
